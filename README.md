# ABOUT
This music player already has 9 inbuilt tracks which can be played by the user. It has a simple user interface, created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It contains all the basic features of a music player, and is pretty easy to use for all. 
The search bar isnâ€™t fully functional yet, we will continue working on this project making it better.
